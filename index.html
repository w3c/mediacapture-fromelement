        This document defines how a stream of media can be captured from a DOM element, such as a
        <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>
        element, in the form of a <code>MediaStream</code> [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document describes an extension to both HTML media elements and the HTML canvas
        element that enables the capture of the output of the element in the form of streaming
        media.
      </p>
      <p>
        The captured media is formed into a <code>MediaStream</code> [[GETUSERMEDIA]], which can
        then be consumed by the various APIs that process streams of media, such as WebRTC
        [[WEBRTC]], or Web Audio [[WEBAUDIO]].

        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this specification

      <h2>
        HTML Media Element Media Capture Extensions
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <code><a>captureStream</a>()</code> and <code><a>captureStreamUntilEnded</a>()</code>
        methods are defined on HTML [[!HTML5]] media elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both <code>MediaStream</code> and <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> expose the concept of a
        <q>track</q>. Since there is no common type used for <code>HTMLMediaElement</code>, this
        document uses the term <dfn>track</dfn> to refer to either <code><dfn><a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#videotrack">VideoTrack</a></dfn></code>
        or <code><dfn><a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#audiotrack">AudioTrack</a></dfn></code>.
        <code><dfn><a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#idl-def-MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack</a></dfn></code>
        is used to identify the media in a <code><dfn><a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#idl-def-MediaStream">MediaStream</a></dfn></code>.
      </p>
      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface HTMLMediaElement">
        <dt>
          MediaStream captureStream()
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The <code><dfn>captureStream</dfn>()</code> method produces a real-time capture of the
            media that is rendered to the media element.
          </p>
          <p>
            The captured <code>MediaStream</code> comprises of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s that
            render the content from the set of <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-videotracklist-selectedindex">selected</a>
            (for <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code>s, or other exclusively selected <a>track</a> types)
            or <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-audiotrack-enabled">enabled</a>
            (for <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code>s, or other <a>track</a> types that support multiple
            selections) <a>track</a>s from the media element. If the media element does not have a
            selected or enabled <a>track</a>s of a given type, then no
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> of that type is present in the captured stream.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element can therefore capture a video
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and any number of audio <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.
            An <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element can capture any number of audio
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s. In both cases, the set of captured
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s could be empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless and until there is a <a>track</a> of given type that is selected or enabled, no
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> of that type is present in the captured stream. In
            particular, if the media element does not have a source assigned, then the captured
            <code>MediaStream</code> has no tracks. Consequently, a media element with a ready
            state of <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-media-have_nothing">HAVE_NOTHING</a>
            produces no captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> instances. Once metadata is
            available and the selected or enabled <a>track</a>s are determined, new captured
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> instances are created and added to the
            <code>MediaStream</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> ends when <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#ended-playback">playback ends</a>
            (and the <code>ended</code> event fires) or when the track that it captures is no
            longer selected or enabled for playback. A track is no longer selected or enabled if
            the source is changed by setting the <code>src</code> or <code>srcObject</code>
            attributes of the media element.
          </p>
          <p>
            The set of captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s change if the source of the media
            element changes. If the source for the media element ends, or the a different source is
            selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the selected <a>VideoTrack</a> or enabled <a>AudioTrack</a>s for the media element
            change, a <code><a href=
            "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-addtrack">addtrack</a></code>
            event with a new <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is generated for each <a>track</a> that
            was not previously selected or enabled; and a <code><a href=
            "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-removetrack">removetrack</a></code>
            events is generated for each <a>track</a> that ceases to be selected or enabled. A
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST end prior to being removed from the
            <code>MediaStream</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> can only end once, a track that is enabled,
            disabled and re-enabled will be captured as two separate tracks. Similarly, restarting
            playback after playback ends causes a new set of captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
            instances to be created. Seeking during playback without changing track selection does
            not generate events or cause a captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s that comprise the captured <code>MediaStream</code>
            become muted or unmuted as the tracks they capture change state. At any time, a media
            element might not have active content available for capture on a given track for a
            variety of reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Media playback could be paused.
            </li>
            <li>A <a>track</a> might not have content for the current playback time if that time is
            either before the content of that track starts or after the content ends.
            </li>
            <li>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that is acting as a source could be <dfn><a href=
            "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#track-muted">muted</a></dfn> or
              <dfn><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#track-enabled">disabled</a></dfn>.
            </li>
            <li>The contents of the <a>track</a> might become inaccessible to the current origin
            due to cross-origin protections. For instance, content that is rendered from an HTTP
            URL can be subject to a redirect on a request for partial content, or the enabled or
            selected tracks can change to include cross-origin content.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Absence of content is reflected in captured tracks through the <code><a href=
            "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastreamtrack-muted">muted</a></code>
            attribute. A captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST have a
            <code><a>muted</a></code> attribute set to <code>true</code> if its corresponding
            source <a>track</a> does not have available and accessible content. A <code><a href=
            "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastreamtrack-mute">mute</a></code>
            event is raised on the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> when content availability changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            What output a muted capture produces as a result will vary based on the type of media:
            a <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code> ceases to capture new frames when muted, causing the
            captured stream to show the last captured frame; a muted <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code>
            produces silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether a media element is actively rendering content (e.g., to a screen or audio
            device) has no effect on the content of captured streams. Muting the audio on a media
            element does not cause the capture to produce silence, nor does hiding a media element
            cause captured video to stop.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          MediaStream captureStreamUntilEnded()
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A stream captured using <code>captureStreamUntilEnded()</code> captures the rendered
            output from a single media resource. The resulting stream ends when the media element
            has <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#ended-playback">ended
            playback</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code><dfn>captureStreamUntilEnded</dfn>()</code> operates in the same way that
            <code><a>captureStream</a>()</code> does, except that when <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#ended-playback">playback ends</a>,
            so do all the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s in the <code>MediaStream</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            All <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s captured using
            <code>captureStreamUntilEnded()</code> end when the media element playback ends. After
            playback has ended, changes to the media element — such as seeking, restarting playback
            or changing the source media — do not result in changes to the captured
            <code>MediaStream</code>.

        HTML Canvas Element Media Capture Extensions
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <code><a href="#canvas-captureStream">captureStream</a>()</code> method is added to the
        HTML [[!HTML5]] canvas element. The resulting <code><a>CanvasCaptureMediaStream</a></code>
        provides methods that allow for controlling when frames are sampled from the canvas.
      </p>
      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface HTMLCanvasElement">
        <dt>
          CanvasCaptureMediaStream captureStream(optional double frameRate)
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The <code id="canvas-captureStream">captureStream()</code> method produces a real-time
            video capture of the surface of the canvas. The resulting media stream has a single
            video <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that matches the dimensions of the canvas element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Content from a canvas that is not <dfn><a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/semantics.html#concept-canvas-origin-clean">
            origin-clean</a></dfn> MUST NOT be captured. This method throws a <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/infrastructure.html#securityerror">SecurityError</a>
            exception if the canvas is not <a>origin-clean</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A captured stream MUST immediately cease to capture content if the <a>origin-clean</a>
            flag of the source canvas becomes false after the stream is created by
            <code>captureStream()</code>. The captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST become
            <a>muted</a>, producing no new content while the canvas remains in this state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each track that captures a canvas has an internal
            <code><dfn>frameCaptureRequested</dfn></code> property that is set to true when a new
            frame is requested from the canvas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value of the <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code> property on all new tracks
            is set to <code>true</code> when the track is created. On creation of the captured
            track with a specific, non-zero <code>frameRate</code>, the <a>user agent</a> starts a
            periodic timer at an interval of <code>1/frameRate</code> seconds. At each activation
            of the timer, the <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code> property is set to
            <code>true</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to support manual control of frame capture with the
            <code><a>requestFrame</a>()</code> method, browsers MUST support a value of 0 for
            <code>frameRate</code>. However, a captured stream MUST request capture of a frame when
            created, even if <code>frameRate</code> is zero.
          </p>
          <p>
            A new frame is requested from the canvas when <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code>
            is true and the canvas is painted. Each time that the captured canvas is painted, the
            following steps are executed:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>For each <var>track</var> capturing from the canvas execute the following steps:
              <ol>
                <li>If new content has been drawn to the canvas since it was last painted, and if
                the <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code> internal property of <var>track</var>
                is set, add a new frame to <var>track</var> containing what was painted to the
                canvas.
                </li>
                <li>If a <code>frameRate</code> value was specified, set the
                <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code> internal property of <var>track</var> to
                <code>false</code>.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            This algorithm results in a captured track not starting until something changes in the

          The <code><dfn>CanvasCaptureMediaStream</dfn></code> is an extension of
          <code>MediaStream</code> that provide a single <code>requestFrame()</code> method.

        Security Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Media elements can render media resources from origins that differ from the origin of the
        media element. In those cases, the contents of the resulting <code>MediaStream</code> MUST
        be protected from access by the document origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        How this protection manifests will differ, depending on how the content is accessed. For
        instance, rendering inaccessible video to a <code>canvas</code> element [[2DCONTEXT]]
        causes the <var><a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext2/#the-image-argument-is-not-origin-clean">origin-clean</a></var>
        property of the canvas to become <code>false</code>; attempting to create a Web Audio
        <code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code> [[WEBAUDIO]] succeeds, but produces no information
        to the document origin (that is, only silence is transmitted into the audio context);
        attempting to transfer the media using WebRTC [[WEBRTC]] results in no information being
        transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origin of the media that is rendered by a media element can change at any time. This is
        even the case for a single media resource. User agents MUST ensure that a change in the
        origin of media doesn't result in exposure of cross origin content.
