      This document defines how a stream of media can be captured from a DOM
      element, such as a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>,
      or <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, in the form of
      a <code>MediaStream</code> [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This document describes an extension to both HTML media elements and the
      HTML canvas element that enables the capture of the output of the element
      in the form of streaming media.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captured media is formed into a <code>MediaStream</code>
      [[GETUSERMEDIA]], which can then be consumed by the various APIs that
      process streams of media, such as WebRTC [[WEBRTC]], or Web Audio
      [[WEBAUDIO]].

      This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
      product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
      contains.

    <p>
      Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this
      specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
      ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as
      this specification uses that specification and terminology.

    <h2>HTML Media Element Media Capture Extensions</h2>

    <p>
      The <code><a>captureStream</a>()</code> and
      <code><a>captureStreamUntilEnded</a>()</code> methods are defined on HTML
      [[!HTML5]] media elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both <code>MediaStream</code> and <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> expose the
      concept of a <q>track</q>.  Since there is no common type used for
      <code>HTMLMediaElement</code>, this document uses the term
      <dfn>track</dfn> to refer to either <code><dfn><a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#videotrack">VideoTrack</a></dfn></code>
      or <code><dfn><a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#audiotrack">AudioTrack</a></dfn></code>.
      <code><dfn><a
      href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#idl-def-MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack</a></dfn></code>
      is used to identify the media in a <code><dfn><a
      href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#idl-def-MediaStream">MediaStream</a></dfn></code>.
    </p>

    <dl class="idl" title="partial interface HTMLMediaElement">
      <dt>MediaStream captureStream()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>captureStream</dfn>()</code> method produces a
          real-time capture of the media that is rendered to the media element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The captured <code>MediaStream</code> comprises of
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s that render the content from the set of
          <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-videotracklist-selectedindex">selected</a>
          (for <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code>s,
          or other exclusively selected <a>track</a> types) or <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-audiotrack-enabled">enabled</a>
          (for <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code>s,
          or other <a>track</a> types that support multiple selections)
          <a>track</a>s from the media element.  If the media element does not
          have a selected or enabled <a>track</a>s of a given type, then no
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> of that type is present in the captured
          stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element can therefore capture a video
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and any number of audio
          <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.  An <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element
          can capture any number of audio <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.  In
          both cases, the set of captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s could
          be empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless and until there is a <a>track</a> of given type that is
          selected or enabled, no <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> of that type is
          present in the captured stream.  In particular, if the media element
          does not have a source assigned, then the
          captured <code>MediaStream</code> has no tracks. Consequently, a media
          element with a ready state
          of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-media-have_nothing">HAVE_NOTHING</a>
          produces no captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> instances.  Once
          metadata is available and the selected or enabled <a>track</a>s are
          determined, new captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> instances are
          created and added to the <code>MediaStream</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> ends
          when <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#ended-playback">playback
          ends</a> (and the <code>ended</code> event fires) or when the track
          that it captures is no longer selected or enabled for playback.  A
          track is no longer selected or enabled if the source is changed by
          setting the <code>src</code> or <code>srcObject</code> attributes of
          the media element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The set of captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s change if the
          source of the media element changes.  If the source for the media
          element ends, or the a different source is selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the selected <a>VideoTrack</a> or enabled <a>AudioTrack</a>s for
          the media element change,
          a <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-addtrack">addtrack</a></code>
          event with a new <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is generated for
          each <a>track</a> that was not previously selected or enabled; and
          a <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-removetrack">removetrack</a></code>
          events is generated for each <a>track</a> that ceases to be selected
          or enabled.  A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST end prior to being
          removed from the <code>MediaStream</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> can only end once, a track that
          is enabled, disabled and re-enabled will be captured as two separate
          tracks.  Similarly, restarting playback after playback ends causes a
          new set of captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> instances to be
          created.  Seeking during playback without changing track selection
          does not generate events or cause a
          captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s that comprise the
          captured <code>MediaStream</code> become muted or unmuted as the
          tracks they capture change state.  At any time, a media element might
          not have active content available for capture on a given track for a
          variety of reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Media playback could be paused.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <a>track</a> might not have content for the current playback time
            if that time is either before the content of that track starts or
            after the content ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that is acting as a source could
            be <dfn><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#track-muted">muted</a></dfn>
            or <dfn><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#track-enabled">disabled</a></dfn>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The contents of the <a>track</a> might become inaccessible to the
            current origin due to cross-origin protections.  For instance,
            content that is rendered from an HTTP URL can be subject to a
            redirect on a request for partial content, or the enabled or
            selected tracks can change to include cross-origin content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Absence of content is reflected in captured tracks through
          the <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastreamtrack-muted">muted</a></code>
          attribute.  A captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST have
          a <code><a>muted</a></code> attribute set to <code>true</code> if its
          corresponding source <a>track</a> does not have available and
          accessible
          content. A <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastreamtrack-mute">mute</code>
          event is raised on the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> when content
          availability changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          What output a muted capture produces as a result will vary based on
          the type of media: a <code><a>VideoTrack</a></code> ceases to capture
          new frames when muted, causing the captured stream to show the last
          captured frame; a muted <code><a>AudioTrack</a></code> produces
          silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether a media element is actively rendering content (e.g., to a
          screen or audio device) has no effect on the content of captured
          streams.  Muting the audio on a media element does not cause the
          capture to produce silence, nor does hiding a media element cause
          captured video to stop.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>MediaStream captureStreamUntilEnded()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A stream captured using <code>captureStreamUntilEnded()</code>
          captures the rendered output from a single media resource.  The
          resulting stream ends when the media element has <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#ended-playback">ended
          playback</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code><dfn>captureStreamUntilEnded</dfn>()</code> operates in the same
          way that <code><a>captureStream</a>()</code> does, except that when
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#ended-playback">playback
          ends</a>, so do all the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s in
          the <code>MediaStream</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s captured
          using <code>captureStreamUntilEnded()</code> end when the media
          element playback ends.  After playback has ended, changes to the media
          element &mdash; such as seeking, restarting playback or changing the source
          media &mdash; do not result in changes to the
          captured <code>MediaStream</code>.

    <h2>HTML Canvas Element Media Capture Extensions</h2>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="#canvas-captureStream">captureStream</a>()</code>
      method is added to the HTML [[!HTML5]] canvas element.  The resulting
      <code><a>CanvasCaptureMediaStream</a></code> provides methods that allow
      for controlling when frames are sampled from the canvas.
    </p>

    <dl class="idl" title="partial interface HTMLCanvasElement">
      <dt>CanvasCaptureMediaStream captureStream(optional double frameRate)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <code id="canvas-captureStream">captureStream()</code> method
          produces a real-time video capture of the surface of the canvas.  The
          resulting media stream has a single
          video <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that matches the dimensions of the
          canvas element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Content from a canvas that is
          not <dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/semantics.html#concept-canvas-origin-clean">origin-clean</a></dfn>
          MUST NOT be captured.  This method throws
          a <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/infrastructure.html#securityerror">SecurityError</a>
          exception if the canvas is not <dfn><a>origin-clean</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A captured stream MUST immediately cease to capture content if
          the <a>origin-clean</a> flag of the source canvas becomes false after
          the stream is created by <code>captureStream()</code>.  The
          captured <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST become <a>muted</a>,
          producing no new content while the canvas remains in this state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each track that captures a canvas has an
          internal <code><dfn>frameCaptureRequested</dfn></code> property that
          is set to true when a new frame is requested from the canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of the <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code> property on
          all new tracks is set to <code>true</code> when the track is created.
          On creation of the captured track with a specific,
          non-zero <code>frameRate</code>, the <a>user agent</a> starts a
          periodic timer at an interval of <code>1/frameRate</code> seconds.  At
          each activation of the timer,
          the <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code> property is set
          to <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to support manual control of frame capture with
          the <code><a>requestFrame</a>()</code> method, browsers MUST support a
          value of 0 for <code>frameRate</code>.  However, a captured stream
          MUST request capture of a frame when created, even
          if <code>frameRate</code> is zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new frame is requested from the canvas
          when <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code> is true and the canvas is
          painted.  Each time that the captured canvas is painted, the following
          steps are executed:
          <ol>
            <li>
              For each <var>track</var> capturing from the canvas execute the
              following steps:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If new content has been drawn to the canvas since it was last
                  painted, and if the <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code>
                  internal property of <var>track</var> is set, add a new frame
                  to <var>track</var> containing what was painted to the canvas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a <code>frameRate</code> value was specified, set
                  the <code><a>frameCaptureRequested</a></code> internal
                  property of <var>track</var> to <code>false</code>.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          This algorithm results in a captured track not starting until
          something changes in the canvas.

      <h2>The <code>CanvasCaptureMediaStream</code></h2>

      <p>
        The <code><dfn>CanvasCaptureMediaStream</dfn></code> is an extension of
        <code>MediaStream</code> that provide a single
        <code>requestFrame()</code> method.  Applications that depend on tight
        control over the rendering of content to the media stream can use this
        method to control when frames from the canvas are captured.
      </p>

      <dl class="idl" title="interface CanvasCaptureMediaStream : MediaStream">
        <dt>readonly attribute HTMLCanvasElement canvas</dt>
        <dd>
          The canvas element that this media stream captures.
        </dd>

        <dt>void requestFrame()</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The <code><dfn>requestFrame</dfn>()</code> method allows
            applications to manually request that a frame from the canvas be
            captured and rendered into the media stream.  In cases where
            applications progressively render to a canvas, this allows
            applications to avoid capturing a partially rendered frame.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            As currently specified, this results in
            no <code>SecurityError</code> or other error feedback if the canvas
            is not origin-clean.  In part, this is because we don't track where
            requests for frames come from.  Do we want to highlight that?

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Media elements can render media resources from origins that differ from
      the origin of the media element.  In those cases, the contents of the
      resulting <code>MediaStream</code> MUST be protected from access by the
      document origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      How this protection manifests will differ, depending on how the content is
      accessed.  For instance, rendering inaccessible video to a
      <code>canvas</code> element [[2DCONTEXT]] causes the <var><a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext2/#the-image-argument-is-not-origin-clean">origin-clean</a></var>
      property of the canvas to become <code>false</code>; attempting to create
      a Web Audio <code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code> [[WEBAUDIO]] succeeds,
      but produces no information to the document origin (that is, only silence
      is transmitted into the audio context); attempting to transfer the media
      using WebRTC [[WEBRTC]] results in no information being transmitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of the media that is rendered by a media element can change at
      any time.  This is even the case for a single media resource.  User agents
      MUST ensure that a change in the origin of media doesn't result in
      exposure of cross origin content.
