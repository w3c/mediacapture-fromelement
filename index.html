        This document defines how a stream of media can be captured from a DOM element, such as a
        [^video^], [^audio^], or [^canvas^]
        element, in the form of a {{MediaStream}} [[GETUSERMEDIA]].

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document describes an extension to both HTML media elements and the HTML canvas
        element that enables the capture of the output of the element in the form of streaming
        media.
      </p>
      <p>
        The captured media is formed into a {{MediaStream}} [[GETUSERMEDIA]], which can
        then be consumed by the various APIs that process streams of media, such as WebRTC
        [[WEBRTC]], or Web Audio [[WEBAUDIO]].

        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this specification

        HTML Media Element Media Capture Extensions
      </h2>
      <p>
        The method {{HTMLMediaElement/captureStream}} is added on HTML [[!HTML5]] media elements.
        Methods for capture are added to both {{HTMLMediaElement}}
        and {{HTMLCanvasElement}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both {{MediaStream}} and {{HTMLMediaElement}} expose the concept
        of a <q>track</q>. Since there is no common type used for
        {{HTMLMediaElement}}, this document uses the term <dfn>track</dfn> to refer
        to either {{VideoTrack}}
        or {{AudioTrack}}.
        {{MediaStreamTrack}}
        is used to identify the media in a {{MediaStream}}.
      </p>
      <div>
        <pre class="idl">partial interface HTMLMediaElement {

            Methods
          </h2>
          <dl class="methods">
            <dt>
              {{HTMLMediaElement/captureStream}}
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                The <dfn data-dfn-for="HTMLMediaElement">captureStream()</dfn> method produces a real-time capture of
                the media that is rendered to the media element.
              </p>
              <p>
                The captured {{MediaStream}} comprises of {{MediaStreamTrack}}s
                that render the content from the set of <a href=
                "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-videotracklist-selectedindex">
                selected</a> (for {{VideoTrack}}s, or other exclusively selected
                <a>track</a> types) or <a href=
                "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-audiotrack-enabled">enabled</a>
                (for {{AudioTrack}}s, or other <a>track</a> types that support
                multiple selections) <a>track</a>s from the media element. If the media element
                does not have a selected or enabled <a>track</a>s of a given type, then no
                {{MediaStreamTrack}} of that type is present in the captured stream.
              </p>
              <p>
                A [^video^] element can therefore capture a video
                {{MediaStreamTrack}} and any number of audio
                {{MediaStreamTrack}}s. An [^audio^] element can capture
                any number of audio {{MediaStreamTrack}}s. In both cases, the set of
                captured {{MediaStreamTrack}}s could be empty.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless and until there is a <a>track</a> of given type that is selected or enabled,
                no {{MediaStreamTrack}} of that type is present in the captured stream. In
                particular, if the media element does not have a source assigned, then the captured
                {{MediaStream}} has no tracks. Consequently, a media element with a ready
                state of <a href=
                "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-have_nothing">HAVE_NOTHING</a>
                produces no captured {{MediaStreamTrack}} instances. Once metadata is
                available and the selected or enabled <a>track</a>s are determined, new captured
                {{MediaStreamTrack}} instances are created and added to the
                {{MediaStream}}.
              </p>
              <p>
                A captured {{MediaStreamTrack}} <a href=
                "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#ends-nostop">ends</a> when <a href=
                "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#ended-playback">playback
                ends</a> (and the <code>ended</code> event fires) or when the track that it
                captures is no longer selected or enabled for playback. A track is no longer
                selected or enabled if the source is changed by setting the {{HTMLMediaElement/src}} or
                {{HTMLMediaElement/srcObject}} attributes of the media element.
              </p>
              <p>
                The set of captured {{MediaStreamTrack}}s change if the source of the
                media element changes. If the source for the media element ends, a different source
                is selected.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the selected {{VideoTrack}} or enabled {{AudioTrack}}s for the media
                element change, a <code><a href=
                "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-addtrack">addtrack</a></code>
                event with a new {{MediaStreamTrack}} is generated for each <a>track</a>
                that was not previously selected or enabled; and a <code><a href=
                "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-removetrack">removetrack</a></code>
                events is generated for each <a>track</a> that ceases to be selected or enabled. A
                {{MediaStreamTrack}} MUST end prior to being removed from the
                {{MediaStream}}.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since a {{MediaStreamTrack}} can only end once, a track that is enabled,
                disabled and re-enabled will be captured as two separate tracks. Similarly,
                restarting playback after playback ends causes a new set of captured
                {{MediaStreamTrack}} instances to be created. Seeking during playback
                without changing track selection does not generate events or cause a captured
                {{MediaStreamTrack}} to end.
              </p>
              <p>
                The {{MediaStreamTrack}}s that comprise the captured
                {{MediaStream}} become muted or unmuted as the tracks they capture change
                state. At any time, a media element might not have active content available for
                capture on a given track for a variety of reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Media playback could be paused.
                </li>
                <li>A <a>track</a> might not have content for the current playback time if that
                time is either before the content of that track starts or after the content ends.
                </li>
                <li>A {{MediaStreamTrack}} that is acting as a source could be
                <dfn><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#track-muted">muted</a></dfn>
                or <dfn><a href=
                "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#track-enabled">disabled</a></dfn>.
                </li>
                <li>The contents of the <a>track</a> might become inaccessible to the current
                origin due to cross-origin protections. For instance, content that is rendered from
                an HTTP URL can be subject to a redirect on a request for partial content, or the
                enabled or selected tracks can change to include cross-origin content.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Absence of content is reflected in captured tracks through the <code><a href=
                "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastreamtrack-muted">muted</a></code>
                attribute. A captured {{MediaStreamTrack}} MUST have a
                <code><a>muted</a></code> attribute set to <code>true</code> if its corresponding
                source <a>track</a> does not have available and accessible content. A
                <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastreamtrack-mute">
                mute</a></code> event is raised on the {{MediaStreamTrack}} when content
                availability changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                What output a muted capture produces as a result will vary based on the type of
                media: a {{VideoTrack}} ceases to capture new frames when muted,
                causing the captured stream to show the last captured frame; a muted
                {{AudioTrack}} produces silence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether a media element is actively rendering content (e.g., to a screen or audio
                device) has no effect on the content of captured streams. Muting the audio on a
                media element does not cause the capture to produce silence, nor does hiding a
                media element cause captured video to stop. Similarly, the audio level or volume of
                the media element does not affect the volume of captured audio.
              </p>
              <p>
                Captured audio from an element with an <a href=
                "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-playbackrate">effective
                playback rate</a> other than 1.0 MUST be time-stretched. An unplayable playback
                rate causes the captured audio track to become muted.

        HTML Canvas Element Media Capture Extensions

      <p>
        The {{HTMLCanvasElement/captureStream}} method is added to the HTML [[!HTML5]] canvas
        element. The resulting {{CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack}} provides methods
        that allow for controlling when frames are sampled from the canvas.

                The <dfn data-dfn-for="HTMLCanvasElement">captureStream()</dfn> method produces a real-time video
                capture of the surface of the canvas. The resulting media stream has a single video
                {{CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack}} that matches the dimensions of
                the canvas element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Content from a canvas that is not <dfn><a href=

                origin-clean</a></dfn> MUST NOT be captured. This method throws a {{SecurityError}}
                exception if the canvas is not <a>origin-clean</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                A captured stream MUST immediately cease to capture content if the
                [= origin-clean =] flag of the source canvas becomes false after the stream is
                created by {{HTMLCanvasElement/captureStream()}}. The captured {{MediaStreamTrack}}
                MUST become <a>muted</a>, producing no new content while the canvas remains in this
                state.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each track that captures a canvas has a
                <dfn data-dfn-for="track">{{track/[[frameCaptureRequested]]}}</dfn> internal slot that is set to <code>true</code> when a
                new frame is requested from the canvas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The value of  {{track/[[frameCaptureRequested]]}} on all new
                tracks is set to <code>true</code> when the track is created. On creation of the
                captured track with a specific, non-zero <var>frameRequestRate</var>, the <a>user
                agent</a> starts a periodic timer at an interval of <code>1/<var>frameRequestRate</var></code>
                seconds. At each activation of the timer,
                {{track/[[frameCaptureRequested]]}} is set to <code>true</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to support manual control of frame capture with the
                {{CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack/requestFrame}}() method, browsers MUST support a value of 0 for
                <var>frameRequestRate</var>. However, a captured stream MUST request capture of a
                frame when created, even if <var>frameRequestRate</var> is zero.
              </p>
              <p>
                This method throws a {{NotSupportedError}} if <var>frameRequestRate</var> is negative.
              </p>
              <p>
                A new frame is requested from the canvas when
                {{track/[[frameCaptureRequested]]}} is true and the canvas is painted. Each
                time that the captured canvas is painted, the following steps are executed:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>For each <var>track</var> capturing from the canvas execute the following
                steps:
                  <ol>
                    <li>If new content has been drawn to the canvas since it was last painted, and
                    if the {{track/[[frameCaptureRequested]]}} internal slot of
                    <var>track</var> is set, add a new frame to <var>track</var> containing what
                    was painted to the canvas.
                    </li>
                    <li>If a <var>frameRequestRate</var> value was specified, set the
                    {{track/[[frameCaptureRequested]]}} internal slot of <var>track</var>

                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                When adding new frames to <var>track</var> containing what was painted to the
                canvas, the alpha channel content of the canvas must be captured and preserved if
                the canvas is not fully opaque. The consumers of this <var>track</var> might not
                preserve the alpha channel.
              </p>
              <p class="note">
                This algorithm results in a captured track not starting until something changes in
                the canvas.

          The {{CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack}}
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <dfn>CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack</dfn> is an extension of
          {{MediaStreamTrack}} that provide a single {{CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack/requestFrame()}} method.
          Applications that depend on tight control over the rendering of content to the media
          stream can use this method to control when frames from the canvas are captured.

                  The <dfn>requestFrame</dfn>() method allows applications to manually
                  request that a frame from the canvas be captured and rendered into the track. In
                  cases where applications progressively render to a canvas, this allows
                  applications to avoid capturing a partially rendered frame.

                  As currently specified, this results in no {{SecurityError}} or other
                  error feedback if the canvas is not origin-clean. In part, this is because we
                  don't track where requests for frames come from. Do we want to highlight that?

        Security Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Media elements can render media resources from origins that differ from the origin of the
        media element. In those cases, the contents of the resulting {{MediaStreamTrack}}
        MUST be protected from access by the document origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        How this protection manifests will differ, depending on how the content is accessed. For
        instance, rendering inaccessible video to a [^canvas^] element [[HTML]]
        causes the [= origin-clean =]
        flag of the canvas to become <code>false</code>; attempting to create a Web Audio
        {{MediaStreamAudioSourceNode}} [[WEBAUDIO]] succeeds, but produces no information
        to the document origin (that is, only silence is transmitted into the audio context);
        attempting to transfer the media using WebRTC [[WEBRTC]] results in no information being
        transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origin of the media that is rendered by a media element can change at any time. This is
        even the case for a single media resource. User agents MUST ensure that a change in the
        origin of media doesn't result in exposure of cross origin content.
